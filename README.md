## Hurricane Prediction System
A Java application that demonstrates the implementation of template pattern and command pattern. Allows for the simulation of different hurricane prediction models (Machine learning -> uses historical and real-time data; Statistical -> uses historical data) or through individual prediction steps (i.e. fetching data or post-processing results). 

### Design Patterns Implemented
